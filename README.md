This is the first basic front end development project created as part of the Free Code Camp curriculum.

I originally created this on CodePen and using Bootstrap.

I realized in my front-end web development journey that I had glossed over some of the basic html/css principles.

So this is my work on this project with only html/css, no bootstrap.
