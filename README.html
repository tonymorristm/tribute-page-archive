<p>This is the first basic front end development project created as part of the Free Code Camp curriculum.</p>
<p>I originally created this on CodePen and used the Bootstrap framework, since the sample project had used this framework.</p>
<p>The user story requirements, were as follows:</p>
<p>User Story: I can view a tribute page with an image and text.</p>
<p>User Story: I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.</p>
<p>I realized in my front-end web development journey that I had glossed over some of the basic html/css principles.</p>
<p>So this is my work on this project with only html/css, no bootstrap. I did look at the bootstrap css file to determine some of the styling.</p>
<p>Although, I had access to the html/css via CodePen, I determined to recreate the project just by looking at the project in a web browser with the aid of Chrome devl tools.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a link to the updated version of the project:</p>
